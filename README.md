# PiControllerAndroid
An Android application Which interfaces with my Raspberry Pi to control it.

My Raspberry Pi Runs a couple Different opperating systems: RetroPie and Raspbian. There are tons of other multi-boot options. To find this multi-boot setup that I used, go to:

Each Operating System runs it's own version of a web server which the Android App communicates with.
The code for these web servers is here:

I also have a web server that does mostly the same thing as this app that is also included in the repo above.
