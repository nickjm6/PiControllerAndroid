# PiControllerAndroid
An Android application Which interfaces with my Raspberry Pi to control it.

My Raspberry Pi Runs 4 Different opperating systems: Kodi(OSMC), RetroPie, Raspbian and Rasplex
To find this multi-boot setup that I used, go to:

Each Operating System runs it's own version of a web server which the Adnroid App communicates with.
The Code for each of these web servers is on my GitHub account:

I also have a web server that does the same thing as this app that is also on my GitHub Account
